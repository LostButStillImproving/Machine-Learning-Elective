a. What to do with missing feature values?
    You can either replace missing values, drop rows with missing values, or drop the entire column

b. How is this done in housing project?
    sample_incomplete_rows.dropna(subset=["total_bedrooms"])

c. What is an Imputer?
    A class that transforms a dataset to fix missing values

Show code how to use SimpleImputer

from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy="median")
housing_num = housing.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])
imputer.fit(housing_num)
X = imputer.transform(housing_num)
housing_tr = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=housing_num.columns,
                          index=housing.index)
d. How to handle text and categorical attributes?
    You can convert the attributes into numerical values, using fx onehotencoder or ordinalencoder
e. Explain the idea behind OneHotEncoder.
    sets the attribute to 1 if present, otherwise 0
f. What is the idea behind min-max scaling and standard scaling?
    To scale features into comparable sizes
g. Why is scaling needed needed?
    Such that the machine learning alg works better, as larger values will be scaled down, and wont have too big effect on the regressions
h. If you use DecisionTreeRegression you get an error rmse = 0.0.
Happy? Is there a better evaluation?
    Not Happy. Indicates overfitting

i. What is fine tuning?
What is the meaning of the hyper parameters:
n_estimators
bootstraping
in RandomForest model.
j. Features have different importance in the model.
Which features have low importance in housing project?
What to do with them?
k. What is the idea behind cross validaton?
